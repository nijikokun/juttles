idle.js
=======

Easy idle user detection via javascript. Monitors movement, key-presses and more in a simple and concise manner.

No third-party support required.

Usage
=====

``` javascript
setIdler(2 * 1000, function () {
  alert('You have been idle for two seconds!');
}, 1000);â€‹
```

It doesn't repeat, so if you want to make this repeatable, make it a recursive function.
